# Pipes-Puzzle

A client for playing Pipes-puzzle was implemented

To start working with the Pipes-Puzzle client, just run the <code>index.html</code> executive file from the <code>/build</code> directory

The Pipes Puzzle client allows you to change the difficulty levels of the pipes map

Working with the application is intuitive ;)

> ##Known limitations of your solution <br>
> 1) Memory leak 
> 2) Long rendering due to the large number of elements (Starting from the 4th level of the game)
> 3) Without the implementation "auto-solver", it is practically impossible to manually pass the levels starting from the 3rd

_`These problems are solvable, but require more time and experience to implement them.`_
